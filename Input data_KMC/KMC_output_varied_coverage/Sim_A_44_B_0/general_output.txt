Stiffness detected at time t = 403.04240472897004:
   All elementary processes that have occurred in the past interval appear as fast and quasi-equilibrated.
   The slowest equilibrated step is 17/18 - O2_diffusion_fwd/O2_diffusion_rev. Occurred 75/77 times. Stiffness coefficient: 1.0000000000000000.
   The fastest equilibrated step is 16/15 - O2_adsorption_rev_hcp/O2_adsorption_fwd_hcp. Occurred 3706/3703 times. Stiffness coefficient: 0.20000000000000001.
   Since the scaling coefficient of the fastest quasi-equilibrated step is below the threshold of 1.0000000000000000, any newly computed scaling coefficients above the threshold have been automatically mapped to 1.
