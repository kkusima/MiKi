Stiffness detected at time t = 49.369451145799793:
   The fastest non-equilibrated step is 3 - CO_adsorption_fwd_hcp. Occurred 7 times (net count if reversible).
   The following rate constants will be adjusted by the scaling coefficients in parenthesis (PEcur/PEori).
   Scaling coefficients above the threshold of 1.0000000000000000 have been automatically mapped to 1.
