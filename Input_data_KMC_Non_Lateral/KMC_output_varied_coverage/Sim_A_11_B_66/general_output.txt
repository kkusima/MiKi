   The fastest non-equilibrated step is 11 - CO_O_oxidation_fwd_hcp. Occurred 24 times (net count if reversible).
   The following rate constants will be adjusted by the scaling coefficients in parenthesis (PEcur/PEori).
   Scaling coefficients above the threshold of 1.0000000000000000 have been automatically mapped to 1.
