   The following rate constants will be adjusted by the scaling coefficients in parenthesis (PEcur/PEori):
     Elementary step 1 - CO_adsorption_fwd_fcc (1.2855138461538475E-010). Occurred 941 times.
     Elementary step 2 - CO_adsorption_rev_fcc (1.2855138461538475E-010). Occurred 941 times.
     Elementary step 3 - CO_adsorption_fwd_hcp (1.6384000000000013E-010). Occurred 1111 times.
     Elementary step 4 - CO_adsorption_rev_hcp (1.6384000000000013E-010). Occurred 1115 times.
     Elementary step 5 - CO_diffusion_fwd (1.9093591726724034E-013). Occurred 936 times.
     Elementary step 6 - CO_diffusion_rev (1.9093591726724034E-013). Occurred 956 times.
