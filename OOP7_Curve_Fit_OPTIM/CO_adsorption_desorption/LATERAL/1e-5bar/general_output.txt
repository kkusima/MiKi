Stiffness possible at time t = 476.42748113602693:
   All elementary processes that have occurred in the past interval appear as fast and quasi-equilibrated.
   Reducing all kinetic constants of these steps by a factor of 0.20000000000000001 to detect potentially slower non-equilibrated dynamics:
   The following rate constants will be adjusted by the scaling coefficients in parenthesis (PEcur/PEori):
