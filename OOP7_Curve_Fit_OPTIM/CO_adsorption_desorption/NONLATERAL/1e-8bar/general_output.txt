Stiffness detected at time t = 6.7082277063721376:
   All elementary processes that have occurred in the past interval appear as fast and quasi-equilibrated.
   The slowest equilibrated step is 3/4 - CO_adsorption_fwd_hcp/CO_adsorption_rev_hcp. Occurred 82/85 times. Stiffness coefficient: 1.0000000000000000.
   The fastest equilibrated step is 6/5 - CO_diffusion_rev/CO_diffusion_fwd. Occurred 2747/2731 times. Stiffness coefficient: 2.0112953303225317E-009.
   Since the scaling coefficient of the fastest quasi-equilibrated step is below the threshold of 1.0000000000000000, any newly computed scaling coefficients above the threshold have been automatically mapped to 1.
